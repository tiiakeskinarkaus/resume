					<h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    I'm studying IT engineering at Centria and I'm looking for a job or trainee position in IT field.
                    I'm interested in software and web development, as well as system support tasks,
                    but I'm open to all entry-level positions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My best qualities as an employee are pressure tolerance, efficiency, accurate work results and 
                    my motivation to learn. I'm innovative and easily get excited about new things and challenges.
                    I enjoy working both alone and in a group. Projects and deadlines bring the best out of me, as I enjoy working
                    efficiently towards a specific destination.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the moment I'm studying the basics of web-developments and I'm going to take game development course in
                    the spring semester. I'm also familiar with some software development tools.
                    I have done one software production project (football results service) as a group work,
                    where I learned about software production. The project was implemented only at the theory level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have a strong background in the hotel and restaurant industry and have great skills in customer service.
                    However, I'm now ready for new challenges!
